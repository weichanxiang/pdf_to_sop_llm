Foods take longer to cook, defrost or reheat than stated. Liquids boil over when cooked by  microwave or combination.Vegetables become wrinkly and hard when cooked/reheated by  microwave.Foods heat unevenly. Only one side of cavity heats. Foods heated by microwave are  hard and tough.Foods “explode” during heating. Foods that have been defrosteddo not heat in the centre.Return to oven for additional cooking. Check oven is plugged into its own 13amp socket. Do not use extension  cable or adapters.The stated times are only a guide.Heating will be improved with the use ofcorrect containers and arranging. Remember to vary the heating, if the  food is colder or heavier than stated.Ensure the oven is cleaned regularly. Use a container twice the volume of the  liquid.Allow standing time when cooking andslightly undercook vegetables, if they  are to be reheated.Arrange foods, so that thicker parts are on the outside of the plate and smaller foods to the centre. Do not heat very dense foods with porous foods as the later will heat faster. Rearrange foods as above. It is impossible for only one side of the cavity to receive microwaves as the energy is distributed by a rotating guide.if the magnetron is no longer working  all food will remain cold.Reduce the time or power with more  delicate foods. Reduce power level.Pierce skins on foods to release pressure build up during heating.  NEVER try to boil eggs in shells.Check that foods are between 1-4°C before going on to reheat. If the edges of the food are getting too warm shield with foil. (See page 49.) CAUSE Food insufficiently heated. Oven not receiving enough power. Food type, size, weight,temperature not exactly as stated. Oven dirty and food debris is absorbing the microwave  energy.Containers too small. Vegetables over-cooked. Foods incorrectly arranged or incompatible foods are being heated together. Foods incorrectly arranged. Foods overcooked. Power level too high.Skins of foods i.e potatoes, chicken are not pierced. Foods have not been sufficiently defrosted orallowed to stand beforereheating.This section tries to solve any common problems you may have. Remember to always keep your Operating Guide on hand for reference.\\n* Affects of the foodsReheating by Microwave 9.Doubling Quantities A reheating time is based on weight and usually atime is given for a particular quantity of food, i.e.11oz Lasagne takes 2 minutes. When the numberof portions to be heated together doubles, then thereheating time will need to be increased by 75-100%. Two portions will take 4 minutes 30seconds to 5 minutes. Generally two lightertextured products such as pastries will take the shorter time, whilsttwo denser products such as Lasagne will take thelonger time. 10.Frozen Foods For speed, some foods can be reheated fromfrozen but they must be foods that can beSTIRRED eg meat sauce, Chilli con Carne. Setthe total reheat time but open the door to stirregularly.DO NOT COVER.AVOID REHEATING solid foods that cannot bestirred, eg Lasagnes/Shepherds Pies from frozen.Avoid reheating PLATED MEALS from frozen. .1.Starting Temperature The colder the food the longer it will take to heat to72°C. Extra time must be allowed if food has beendefrosted as the centre may still be icy. 2.Headspace When heating liquids, ensure they do notcompletely fill their containers; a headspace allowsthe liquids to be stirred during and at the end ofthe heating time without spillage. 3.Covering foods A container covered with either cling film, a plasticplate cover or even the lid to the dish, will heatfractionally faster then an uncovered dish. Do notcover foods which require a drier texture, such aspastries, as the steam that becomes trappedunder the cover will cause the food to go soggy. 4.Crisp Foods Reheat pastry and bread items, such as sausagerolls, pies and croissants, on a plastic rack toreduce the chance of “sogginess”. The rack allowsthe air to circulate beneath the food and removesteam which causes moist, limp pastry. YourPanasonic Combi offers a COMBINATION facilitywhich will help crisp pastry items as they reheat. 5.Uneven shapes When heating uneven shaped pieces of food,place the thick part of one piece against the thinpart of the second. This helps the food to heatmore evenly. 6.Porous Foods/Dense foods Porous foods reheat more quickly than denseheavy foods. 7.Food with “Skins” When reheating foods with a skin such as fish,chicken or baked beans, reduce the power to alower setting to prevent the food from heating tooquickly and “exploding”. 8.Heating two dishes together It is possible to reheat two products with the sameheating time together. For example, two ChickenCurries with a reheating time of 4 minutes each orone Taglatelle Carbonara and one moussaka, bothof which have a heating time of 4 minutes each.\\n* Tips for Reheating your own Homemade Foods Serving foods prepared in-house gives a homemade quality to the menu and allows for seasonality. However, for best results, follow the tips below if they are to be regenerated in your Panasonic Combi Oven. 1.Overcooking Do not overcook vegetables - slightly undercook them, and they will finish cooking during the reheating time. 2.Sauces Make any foods in sauces with lighter gravies rather than heavy, thick ones, as this helps the food heat evenly. 3.Plated Meals To ensure even heating arrange the singlecomponent foods of a plated meal carefully. Place denser foods, such as whole vegetablesand portions of meat or fish, to the outside of theplate, and smaller items, towards the centre. Do not pile foods up but keep them in a singlelayer; mashed patato should be spread out ratherthan mounded up. The food can look attactive butalways give the Microwave a chance to heatevenly and thoroughly. 4.Vegetables Dot vegetables with butter and pour gravy over themeat to prevent drying out and to help with evenheating. 5.Rice Arrange meat sauces served with rice, side byside rather than in the traditional circle of rice withthe sauce in the centre. The sauce should beflattened slightly, whilst the rice is piled up. 6.Potato Topped Pies Potato-topped pies and au gratin dishes, egCottage Pie, are difficult to reheat as theconsistency of the potato will heat faster. Alwaysensure the filling is deeper than the potato. 7.Stirring Stir any sauce- based foods before heating,particularly if they have been defrosted. Thisensures any icy particles or cold areas are fullybroken up and the food is of an even temperature. 8.Browning/Finishing Dishes If you are preparing dishes in bulk for freezing orrefrigeration, don’t forget that because yourPanasonic Combi is a microwave andconventional oven, you can choose to brownfoods at the end of preparation but before storing,or store unbrowned and reheat on CONVECTION.9.Heating two dishes together  If you wish to reheat more than one dish, placethem side by side on the base of the cavity andNEVER use the Wire Rack Shelf for reheating on 2 levels. 10.Heating Times It is impossible to give the heating time of anindividual plated meal as each will contain adifferent variety of foods in differing quantities.Follow the arranging tips already mentioned andensure the thickest piece of food has reached 72°C.

Extra time must be allowed if food has beendefrosted as the centre may still be icy. 2.Headspace When heating liquids, ensure they do notcompletely fill their containers; a headspace allowsthe liquids to be stirred during and at the end ofthe heating time without spillage. 3.Covering foods A container covered with either cling film, a plasticplate cover or even the lid to the dish, will heatfractionally faster then an uncovered dish. Do notcover foods which require a drier texture, such aspastries, as the steam that becomes trappedunder the cover will cause the food to go soggy. 4.Crisp Foods Reheat pastry and bread items, such as sausagerolls, pies and croissants, on a plastic rack toreduce the chance of “sogginess”. The rack allowsthe air to circulate beneath the food and removesteam which causes moist, limp pastry. YourPanasonic Combi offers a COMBINATION facilitywhich will help crisp pastry items as they reheat. 5.Uneven shapes When heating uneven shaped pieces of food,place the thick part of one piece against the thinpart of the second. This helps the food to heatmore evenly. 6.Porous Foods/Dense foods Porous foods reheat more quickly than denseheavy foods. 7.Food with “Skins” When reheating foods with a skin such as fish,chicken or baked beans, reduce the power to alower setting to prevent the food from heating tooquickly and “exploding”. 8.Heating two dishes together It is possible to reheat two products with the sameheating time together. For example, two ChickenCurries with a reheating time of 4 minutes each orone Taglatelle Carbonara and one moussaka, bothof which have a heating time of 4 minutes each.\\n\\n Q: A part of my food heats up but the other part doesn\\'t, what do I do?\\n A:'}]\n"

            "* Common Problems PROBLEM SOLUTION Food cools quickly after Microwave or Combination cooking. Foods take longer to cook, defrost or reheat than stated. Liquids boil over when cooked by  microwave or combination.Vegetables become wrinkly and hard when cooked/reheated by  microwave.Foods heat unevenly. Only one side of cavity heats. Foods heated by microwave are  hard and tough.Foods “explode” during heating. Foods that have been defrosteddo not heat in the centre.Return to oven for additional cooking. Check oven is plugged into its own 13amp socket. Do not use extension  cable or adapters.The stated times are only a guide.Heating will be improved with the use ofcorrect containers and arranging. Remember to vary the heating, if the  food is colder or heavier than stated.Ensure the oven is cleaned regularly. Use a container twice the volume of the  liquid.Allow standing time when cooking andslightly undercook vegetables, if they  are to be reheated.Arrange foods, so that thicker parts are on the outside of the plate and smaller foods to the centre. Do not heat very dense foods with porous foods as the later will heat faster. Rearrange foods as above. It is impossible for only one side of the cavity to receive microwaves as the energy is distributed by a rotating guide.if the magnetron is no longer working  all food will remain cold.Reduce the time or power with more  delicate foods. Reduce power level.Pierce skins on foods to release pressure build up during heating.  NEVER try to boil eggs in shells.Check that foods are between 1-4°C before going on to reheat. If the edges of the food are getting too warm shield with foil. (See page 49.) CAUSE Food insufficiently heated. Oven not receiving enough power. Food type, size, weight,temperature not exactly as stated. Oven dirty and food debris is absorbing the microwave  energy.Containers too small. Vegetables over-cooked. Foods incorrectly arranged or incompatible foods are being heated together. Foods incorrectly arranged. Foods overcooked. Power level too high.Skins of foods i.e potatoes, chicken are not pierced. Foods have not been sufficiently defrosted orallowed to stand beforereheating.This section tries to solve any common problems you may have. Remember to always keep your Operating Guide on hand for reference.\n",
