How a Microwave Works,"How a Microwave Works 1.Reflection They will REFLECT off metal. The inner walls of your oven are made of stainlesssteel, so that the microwave energy can bounce evenly around the cavity. Of course, the microwaves will also reflect off metal cooking containers andaccessories, such as saucepans and platters. For this reason, NEVER use the WireRack Shelf on Microwave only. 2.Transmission The microwaves will TRANSMIT through paper, plastic, glass and china and,therefore, it is containers made of these substances that are used in microwavecookery. 3.Absorption The microwave energy is ABSORBED by the food. The energy penetrates theoutside area of the food causing the molecules to vibrate over 2,450,000,000 timesa second. This vibration causes the water molecules to rub against each otherproducing frictional heat which cooks this outer part of the food; the heat is thencouducted through the food to cook the centre. Food, therefore, cooks from theoutside, inwards. Standing Time The heat that builds up on the outside of the food is still being conducted to the centre, even after the microwave oven has switched off. This period is know as the “Standing Time”. The time it takes for the food tofinish cooking will vary depending on its shape, size and type. For example, a jacket potato will need to standfor at least 5-10 minutes after the end of the cooking time and during this time the temperature at the centre willincrease. A pastry pie that has been reheated will only need a standing time of 1-2 minutes for heat todistribute evenly.If the food is put back in the Microwave and heated again before the standing time has elapsed, the food canvery quickly become overcooked.To get the most from your Panasonic Combi it is helpful to understand how the oven works as a Microwave. Once connected to an outlet, the electricity flows along the flex and is converted into microwave energy by the MAGNETRON. Microwaves are ultra high frequency waves, and belong to the same category as radio andtelevision waves. These are directed into the cavity through the WAVE GUIDE.When they reach the cavity, the microwaves will behave in one of three ways: ",40,464
Reheating by Microwave,"Reheating by Microwave 1.Choosing the correct reheat time When heating foods for the first time it isnecessary to experiment, to obtain the correcttimings. Standardising portion size and ensuringrefrigeration runs without variation will enable aroutine to be developed for a particular foodproduct. Always remember that the times given byboth microwaveand food manufacturers are approximate andshould be used as a guideline. 2.Stirring Wherever possible stir food halfway through theheating time and again at the end. This ensuresthe heat spreads evenly throughout the food. 3.Is the food safely reheated ? A high level of hygiene is necessary to preventfood poisoning by such bacteria as Lysteria andSalmonella. Your Panasonic Combi will heat foodto the temperatures required and will do so muchfaster than other methods of heating. TheDepartment of Health has stated that atemperature of 70°C maintained for 2 minutes will ensure the complete destruction of Lysteria andSalmonella bacteria and the right heating time,coupled with the standing time, makes certain thefood has been heated correctly.What you can do - Ensure food has reached a temperature of at least 72°C . Check the centre and the thickest part of the food with a foodthermometer as these are the last areas to heat.When the catering operation has beenstandardised as much as possible, it will not benecessary to check every dish that passes throughthe microwave oven, but an occasional spot checkensures the food is being served to the higheststandards.4.Standing food before serving Allow food to stand at the end of the heating time.For small items, eg. sausage rolls, by the time thedish has been collected and served it will have hadsufficient standing time. Foods such as meat piesand plated meals, however, will need 1-2 minutesfor the heat to completely penetrate the centre. Donot be tempted to put the food back for additionalheating time until after the standing time has beencompleted; putting the food back too soon will onlyresult in overcooked and wasted food. Thestanding time can be used affectively to addadditional foods to the plate, or to gamishattractively before serving. Affects of the dish 1.shape A round dish heats food more evenly than asquare dish. The corners of a square dish receivedouble microwave energy and result in bubblingovercooked corners whilst the centre of the food iscold. Oval dishes give a better result but there maystill be areas of hot bubbling food at the the two“ends”. 2.Depth A shallow dish heats more quickly than a deepdish. Microwave energy only penetrates theoutside of the food. food in a shallow dish heatsevenly from all directions. In a deep dish the foodin the centre relies on conduction and takes longerto heat.3.Material Heavy earthenware and china dishes will slow theheating process by absorbing some of the heatfrom the food itself. A thinner, lighter china is abetter choice as this will not impede the cookingtime. 4.Glazed finish Always choose a glazed dish. An unglazed orchipped container can absorb water when it iswashed. As microwave energy is attracted tomoisture the water molecules contained in thechina heat up, not only causing the dish to get hotbut also slowing down the reheating time.  5.Shape of base If possible, always choose a dish that has roundedrather than sharp corners at the  base to preventover cooking.The microwave mode of your Panasonic Combi will be most frequently used to reheat food. Although the oven  is provided with a rotating wave guide, all reheating times, and uniformity of heating, will vary according toseveral factors as below.Microwave",41,767
Affects of the foodsReheating by Microwave,"Affects of the foodsReheating by Microwave 9.Doubling Quantities A reheating time is based on weight and usually atime is given for a particular quantity of food, i.e.11oz Lasagne takes 2 minutes. When the numberof portions to be heated together doubles, then thereheating time will need to be increased by 75-100%. Two portions will take 4 minutes 30seconds to 5 minutes. Generally two lightertextured products such as pastries will take the shorter time, whilsttwo denser products such as Lasagne will take thelonger time. 10.Frozen Foods For speed, some foods can be reheated fromfrozen but they must be foods that can beSTIRRED eg meat sauce, Chilli con Carne. Setthe total reheat time but open the door to stirregularly.DO NOT COVER.AVOID REHEATING solid foods that cannot bestirred, eg Lasagnes/Shepherds Pies from frozen.Avoid reheating PLATED MEALS from frozen. .1.Starting Temperature The colder the food the longer it will take to heat to72°C. Extra time must be allowed if food has beendefrosted as the centre may still be icy. 2.Headspace When heating liquids, ensure they do notcompletely fill their containers; a headspace allowsthe liquids to be stirred during and at the end ofthe heating time without spillage. 3.Covering foods A container covered with either cling film, a plasticplate cover or even the lid to the dish, will heatfractionally faster then an uncovered dish. Do notcover foods which require a drier texture, such aspastries, as the steam that becomes trappedunder the cover will cause the food to go soggy. 4.Crisp Foods Reheat pastry and bread items, such as sausagerolls, pies and croissants, on a plastic rack toreduce the chance of “sogginess”. The rack allowsthe air to circulate beneath the food and removesteam which causes moist, limp pastry. YourPanasonic Combi offers a COMBINATION facilitywhich will help crisp pastry items as they reheat. 5.Uneven shapes When heating uneven shaped pieces of food,place the thick part of one piece against the thinpart of the second. This helps the food to heatmore evenly. 6.Porous Foods/Dense foods Porous foods reheat more quickly than denseheavy foods. 7.Food with “Skins” When reheating foods with a skin such as fish,chicken or baked beans, reduce the power to alower setting to prevent the food from heating tooquickly and “exploding”. 8.Heating two dishes together It is possible to reheat two products with the sameheating time together. For example, two ChickenCurries with a reheating time of 4 minutes each orone Taglatelle Carbonara and one moussaka, bothof which have a heating time of 4 minutes each.",42,624
Tips for Reheating your own Homemade Foods,"Tips for Reheating your own Homemade Foods Serving foods prepared in-house gives a homemade quality to the menu and allows for seasonality. However, for best results, follow the tips below if they are to be regenerated in your Panasonic Combi Oven. 1.Overcooking Do not overcook vegetables - slightly undercook them, and they will finish cooking during the reheating time. 2.Sauces Make any foods in sauces with lighter gravies rather than heavy, thick ones, as this helps the food heat evenly. 3.Plated Meals To ensure even heating arrange the singlecomponent foods of a plated meal carefully. Place denser foods, such as whole vegetablesand portions of meat or fish, to the outside of theplate, and smaller items, towards the centre. Do not pile foods up but keep them in a singlelayer; mashed patato should be spread out ratherthan mounded up. The food can look attactive butalways give the Microwave a chance to heatevenly and thoroughly. 4.Vegetables Dot vegetables with butter and pour gravy over themeat to prevent drying out and to help with evenheating. 5.Rice Arrange meat sauces served with rice, side byside rather than in the traditional circle of rice withthe sauce in the centre. The sauce should beflattened slightly, whilst the rice is piled up. 6.Potato Topped Pies Potato-topped pies and au gratin dishes, egCottage Pie, are difficult to reheat as theconsistency of the potato will heat faster. Alwaysensure the filling is deeper than the potato. 7.Stirring Stir any sauce- based foods before heating,particularly if they have been defrosted. Thisensures any icy particles or cold areas are fullybroken up and the food is of an even temperature. 8.Browning/Finishing Dishes If you are preparing dishes in bulk for freezing orrefrigeration, don’t forget that because yourPanasonic Combi is a microwave andconventional oven, you can choose to brownfoods at the end of preparation but before storing,or store unbrowned and reheat on CONVECTION.9.Heating two dishes together  If you wish to reheat more than one dish, placethem side by side on the base of the cavity andNEVER use the Wire Rack Shelf for reheating on 2 levels. 10.Heating Times It is impossible to give the heating time of anindividual plated meal as each will contain adifferent variety of foods in differing quantities.Follow the arranging tips already mentioned andensure the thickest piece of food has reached 72°C.

Defrosting by Microwave,"Defrosting by Microwave Follow these tips for best results: 1.Meat Place meats on a rack, trivet or upturned saucer ina shallow dish. This enables the water to drainfrom the food and defrost correctly; if the food sitsin the liquid it is likely to begin to cook and apoached effect is created. 2.Foods in Foil Transfer foods packaged in aluminium foilcontainers into suitable microwaveable dishesbefore defrosting. 3.Arranging Arrange the food evenly and in a shallow layer onthe rack or plate. Do not pile foods up as this willprevent the food at the bottom from defrosting inthe same time as the food on the top. 4.Uneven Shapes Always arrange thick areas of the food to theoutside of the dish, and thinner areas to thecentre. this is particularly important for chops andchicken portions. Where possible, arrange twouneven shaped pieces of food in a dish with thethick area of one piece to the thin area of theother, to ensure even defrosting. 5.Shielding Check food to ensure it does not over-defrost.Remove any defrosted food, if possible, and turnand shield thinner areas of food. It will benecessary to shield the breast, ends of the legsand wings on a chicken, and the head and tail of awhole fish. Separate items such as chops,sausages and steaks and rearrange in a singlelayer as soon as possible. To shield, coverdefrosted, and thinner, or fatty areas of food, withsmall pieces of aluminium foil. This will reflect themicrowave energy away from that area to preventit from over defrosting and beginning to cook.Check foods at least twice duringthe defrosting time and shield, as necessary,ensuring the foil is still securely in place.N.B. Ensure the foil does not touch the side or roofof the cavity or “arcing” my occur. If this doeshappen, stop the microwave and rearrange thefoods. 6.Cooling For best results DEFROST foods in a cool oven.(See page 35.) 7.Standing Time Food should still feel icy at the end of thedefrosting time; this will disappear during thestanding time. Do NOT be tempted to put foodback to continue to defrost in the microwave asthis will lead to over defrosting. Allow small itemsof food to stand for 15 minutes before cooking;larger pieces of food will need longer. Cover foodsduring the standing time, to prevent contaminationby airborne bacteria. 8.Container Shape Foods in square shaped containers need carefulattention during defrosting to prevent corners frombeginning  to cook. It may be necessary to stoplarger portions of food during the defrosting time toshield the corners with aluminium foil. Afterdefrosting, always remember to transfer the foodinto more suitable, round containers beforereheating in the microwave. 9.Stirring Foods that can be stirred, such as curries,casseroles and meat sauces, should, as thedefrosting time progresses, be broken up andstirred. Stir the food before, and after, the standingtime as this helps to break up the ice particles andspeed up defrosting.  10.Solid foods Foods that can not be stirred, eg lasagne, CottagePie and pastry-topped dishes, benefit fromstanding for a period of time in the middle ofdefrosting. This enables the product to defrostthrough to the centre without the edges becomingexcessively hot, use the Multi-stage programmefacility. See page 17. 11.Foods not listed in Defrost Charts To defrost food not mentioned in the charts, selectthe Defrost power setting and as a rough GUIDE,allow 20-30 seconds per 1oz/25g of food. Whenusing this method do not leave the foodunattended as it defrosts, but check frequently. NOTE: Calculate the defrosting time accurately and followany specific instructions.  The ability to defrost foods quickly is another excellent benefit of your Panasonic Combi.The quality of the defrosted food will depend a great deal on the care the food receives in freezing and defrosting, so alwaysensure that the best food is frozen and that it is packaged correctly.Ensure the freezer is running at the correct temperature(-18°C or below) and that it is not overloaded with foodor ice. Always label and date foods so that they can be used in strict rotation.Always defrost using the Defrost power setting. NEVER try hurry the defrosting by selecting a higher powerlevel as this will only over-defrost the food, causing it to become tough and inedible leading to waste.Microwave",51,984

.Arranging,".Arranging When cooking fillets or whole fish, always arrangethe thicker part to the outside of the container and,wherever possible, make even-shaped parcels offish. Cook two whole fish together, placed head totail with backbone towards the outside of the dish. 2.Shielding Single whole fish will need to have the head andtail ends shielded with aluminium foil halfwaythrough the cooking time. (See page 49)Cooking by Microwave Fish 3.Whole fish  Score the sides of whole fish prior to cooking; thisprevents the skin from bursting and splattering theoven cavity. A better result is obtained if whole fishare cooked on a LOWER power setting rather thanHIGH power. 4.Fish fillets Fish fillets should be rolled so that the head andtail of the fillet overlap forming a fish parcel. Anynumber of fillets can be cooked together, on HIGHpower, in this way. Arranging food in this mannermeans that it cooks evenly and without the need toshield with aluminium foil. VegetablesCommercial ovens are primarily used for reheating and defrosting. It is possible however to cook certain foodseg. fish and vegetables very successfully by microwave. These foods should be limited to small quantities aslarger amounts will not offer any time saving. 1.Adding salt Vegetables cooked by microwave, retain theircolour and texture. The short cooking times andsmall quantity of cooking liquid required ensuresthe vegetables do not lose their nutritive value. Do not add salt to the vegetables. 2.Cooking vegetables together  It is possible to cook a selection of vegetablestogether in the same dish if they have roughly thesame cooking time per pound. Do not, forexample, cook new potatoes alongside frozenpeas, as the peas will be cooked and the potatoesalmost raw. 3.Adding water A small amount of water is required to generatesufficient steam to begin to cook the vegetables;the microwave energy will then complete thecooking within the vegetables themselves. If toomuch liquid is added this will increase the cookingtime considerably.4.Container size Choose the size of the dish to match the quantityof vegetables to be cooked. A large, covered bowlwith only a handful of food in the base does notcook very well. 5.Arranging Always arrange the denser parts of the vegetablesto the outside of the dish. With vegetables such asbroccoli the denser part is the stalk. 6.Part-cooking If the vegetables are going to be pre-cooked forplating up, refrigerating and regenerating at a laterdate, reduce the cooking time by about a third;during the reheating time the vegetables willcomplete their cooking, retaining their “bite”.  7.Standing time It is important to allow vegetables to stand beforetesting to see if they are correctly cooked. Thisprevents the vegetables over cooking andbecoming tough.",54,591

Always reheat foods in a preheated oven.Reheating by Combination Tips for Reheating Commercially Prepared Foods Many Commercially prepared foods are ideal for reheating on COMBINATION - offering the advantage of large time saving as only a fraction of the conventional heating time is required. It also means that many foods willhave a “freshly cooked” appearance due to the crisping and browning  that takes place -more appetising formany recipes than MICROWAVE only. 1.Using Supplier’s Instructions Check the pack instructions carefully as these willbe a good indication of how to choose yourcombination programme.  2.Choosing the Programme Refer to the following charts and find a similarfood to select an appropriate programme. Manycommercially frozen foods are partially cooked eg quiche, may have a part-cooked pastry basewith an uncooked filling, or an en croute may befully cooked in the centre even if the pastry is raw.CHECK CAREFULLY whether the food is alreadycooked and requires reheating only or whether itcontains uncooked components and must bethroughly cooked before serving. Generally, a food that requires cooking will be moresuccessful on a lower Temperature/Microwavepower and longer heating time. Foods that require reheating only are heated for ashorter time and may benefit from highertemperatures. 3.Checking Temperature Always ensure that the food has reached atemperature of at least 72°C if it is beingreheated.If the food requires cooking, then checkit has reached the appropriate temperature. 4.Variations in weight If the foods to be reheated vary in weight fromthose shown in the charts over, reduce/increasethe times appropriately. If the products are reheated by a Multi-stage(sequential) programme, reduce/increase theMICROWAVE only times first but leave thebrowning GRILL times the same. If cooking/reheating products from frozen by aMulti-stage(sequential) programme double themicrowave time given for reheating from “fridge”temperature and add a further 50-75% extra to thebrowning GRILL time.If cooking/reheating products from frozen by astraight COMBINATION CONVECTION setting,add approximately 50% extra time to the timerequired from “fridge” temperature.5.Containers If a particuiarly solid food or dish that cannot bestirred eg Lasagne, is contained in foil, transfer to asuitable non-metallic dish whilst frozen. 6.Pre-browned foods Many commercially prepared cooked foods eg.sausages may be pre-browned. These are oftenbetter reheated by MICROWAVE only rather thanCOMBINATION. Foods that are pre-browned, butrequire further crisping, should be reheated onCOMBINATION CONVECTION /GRILL CONVECTION / FAN GRILL. 7.Arranging It is essential that individual items are arrangedevenly for thorough reheating by MICROWAVE andbrowning by GRILL/CONVECTION/FAN GRILL/GRILL CONVECTION.Combination",65,663
Cooking Fish on Combination,"Cooking Fish on Combination 1.Arranging When cooking fillets or whole fish, always arrangethe thicker part to the outside of the container. Twofish cooked together should be placed head to tail,with the backbone towards the outside to the dish.Fish steaks should be arranged with the thinnertall end towards the centre. DO NOT PILE fish up -for best results cook in a single layer. 2.Adding fat / oil / seasoning To help keep the fish moist, brush with oil or dotwith butter before cooking. DO NOT season withsalt. 3.Covering DO NOT COVER fish when cooking byCOMBINATION. 4.Shelf position For GRILL COMBINATION which is suitable forsmall whole fish, steaks, fillets, use UPPER shelfposition. For CONVECTION COMBINATIONwhich is suitable for larger whole fish, use LOWERshelf position. 5.Accessories / Containers DO NOT use metal containers for cooking byCOMBINATION - microwave-safe glass orceramics are ideal. If the fish is placed on theCeramic Insulating Tray, ensure it is thoroughlycleaned beforehand. 1.Turning / Basting / Draining For best results, joints of meat should be turnedhalfway through cooking and basted. Drain awayany excess meat juices and fat. 2.Shielding Unevenly shaped joints will benefit from shieldingwith smooth pieces of aluminium foil. However,ensure the foil is not in contact with Wire RackShelf, walls, roof or door of the oven. Shield thinends of legs of lamb and corners of rolled joints. 3.Covering DO NOT cover meat joints when cooking byCombination. 4.Accessories / Containers If the joints are placed on the Ceramic InsulatingTray, ensure it is thoroughly cleaned before use. 5.Shelf position Use the LOWER shelf position.Tips for cooking joints of meat on Combination 6.Calculating the Cooking Time As a rough guide, cook the joints for 1/2to 2/3of the total conventional cooking time.When cooking by combination, drop theconvection temperature by 10°C compared to thenormal convection temperature.Always under-estimate the cooking time and returnthe joint for further cooking if necessary. Checkinternal temperature before STANDING.  7.Standing Allow joints to STAND for 20 minutes beforecarving. 8.Maximum Weight DO NOT attempt to cook joints over 6lb (2.7kg) inweight. Avoid excessively fatty joints. 9.Maximum Microwave Power For best results ONLY use SIMMER or DEFROSTpower to avoid over-cooking and drying out thejoints.Cooking Meat on Combination",66,549

For poultry, best resultsare obtained by using the same temperature as forconventional cooking. Check the internaltemperature before STANDING. 6.Standing Allow poultry to STAND for 15-20 minutes beforecarving. 7.Maximum Weight DO NOT attempt to cook joints over 6lb (2.7kg) inweight. Avoid excessively fatty joints.Cooking Meat on Combination 1.Turning Most thicker, cuts benefit from turning duringcooking. When turning, remove Wire Rack Shelfcompletely. If cooking small items directly onCeramic Insulating Tray, remove tray to turn food -DO NOT leave shelf extended from oven as thereis NO NON-TIP SAFETY LOCK. 2.Arranging Arrange small cuts evenly and for best results usefull width of oven. DO NOT pile foods on top ofeach other, arrange in a single layer only. 3.Draining Juices For best results, place food directly on Wire RackShelf using Ceramic Insulating Tray on base ofoven to catch drips. This tray must be removed forcleaning to avoid excessive smoke/splatter and tocook efficiently.Small items can be placed directly on Ceramic Insulating Tray on top of Wire Rack Shelf.  4.Standing Time Small cuts require 5-10 minutes STANDING timebefore serving.Tips for cooking Small Cuts on Combination 5.Calculating the Cooking Time Cooking small cuts on Combination grill allowsmost cuts to brown and crisp more quickly thanwhen conventionally grilled. Allow roughly  2/3the conventional time as a guide. 6.Container DO NOT place food on a metal tray/container asthis will slow down cooking time by reducing effectof Microwave Power. 7.Cleaning the Oven It is essential that the oven is kept very clean forCombination Grill, to avoid excess smoke andsplatter.

Common Problems,"Common Problems PROBLEM SOLUTION Food cools quickly after Microwave or Combination cooking. Foods take longer to cook, defrost or reheat than stated. Liquids boil over when cooked by  microwave or combination.Vegetables become wrinkly and hard when cooked/reheated by  microwave.Foods heat unevenly. Only one side of cavity heats. Foods heated by microwave are  hard and tough.Foods “explode” during heating. Foods that have been defrosteddo not heat in the centre.Return to oven for additional cooking. Check oven is plugged into its own 13amp socket. Do not use extension  cable or adapters.The stated times are only a guide.Heating will be improved with the use ofcorrect containers and arranging. Remember to vary the heating, if the  food is colder or heavier than stated.Ensure the oven is cleaned regularly. Use a container twice the volume of the  liquid.Allow standing time when cooking andslightly undercook vegetables, if they  are to be reheated.Arrange foods, so that thicker parts are on the outside of the plate and smaller foods to the centre. Do not heat very dense foods with porous foods as the later will heat faster. Rearrange foods as above. It is impossible for only one side of the cavity to receive microwaves as the energy is distributed by a rotating guide.if the magnetron is no longer working  all food will remain cold.Reduce the time or power with more  delicate foods. Reduce power level.Pierce skins on foods to release pressure build up during heating.  NEVER try to boil eggs in shells.Check that foods are between 1-4°C before going on to reheat. If the edges of the food are getting too warm shield with foil. (See page 49.) CAUSE Food insufficiently heated. Oven not receiving enough power. Food type, size, weight,temperature not exactly as stated. Oven dirty and food debris is absorbing the microwave  energy.Containers too small. Vegetables over-cooked. Foods incorrectly arranged or incompatible foods are being heated together. Foods incorrectly arranged. Foods overcooked. Power level too high.Skins of foods i.e potatoes, chicken are not pierced. Foods have not been sufficiently defrosted orallowed to stand beforereheating.This section tries to solve any common problems you may have.

Common Queries,"Common Queries Question Answer Can I use the oven Off-Shore ? Where can I obtain additional oven accessories ?Can the oven be stacked? Can I dry tea towels and clothes in  the oven ? How often should the oven be serviced ?Yes if the supply is 50Hz. The oven will not Operate at 60Hz.Contact the manufacturer or the dealer from whom you purchased  the oven.Do not stack your Panasonic Combi Oven on other microwaves of similar or different models. It is best to site your oven clear of all other kitchen equipment which may produce excess humidity i.e.  oven ranges, deep-fat fryers etc.No. Never put these, or similar items in your Panasonic Combi Oven. It is best to be guided by your authorised Service Agent. This depends on usage however keep oven clean.Common Problems PROBLEM SOLUTION Dishes get hot. Condensation appears in the  cavity and door. Steam is expelled from around the door. Smoke appears around the door when grilling. The ceramic cavity base cracks.This is normal, particularly in covered  dishes. Remove lids/film carefully to  prevent steam burns. Carry out the dish test given withGlossary of Terms. Do not use  unsuitable dishes.This is normal and an excellent way of heating the plate !  This is normal and the condensation should be wiped off a soft cloth.  Ensure air vents are not blocked.This is normal. The intricate workings of the door safety devices will prevent the escape of microwave energy but  not steam or cooking smells.Stop the oven and drain away all excessfat and juices. Watch the food carefully as it grills. Ensure the cavity ceiling is cleaned regularly.Be careful to place the food carefully onthe base of the cavity. Do not slam ordrop the food: the base is made fromceramic not painted metal.CAUSE Steam trapped within  container transferring heat to dish.The dish is absorbing the microwave energy. If the “Preheat” function is inoperation, the dish will absorbsome of the residual heat in  the  cavity. Food is heating faster than the steam can be expelled. The steam is finding an exit from cavity. Fat from foods is splashing onto the grill elements and burning. Operator mis-use.Common Queries",77,451
